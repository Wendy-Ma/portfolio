# Portfolio
Welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! This is where Iâ€™ll showcase all my exciting work.
# About me
Hi, I am Wendy Ma, a data enthusiast. I hope to bridge business and data and tap the full potential power of data in the workplace. I have done internships in various industries-- including supply chain, fashion retail and even telecommunication. I could see how good techniques in utilizing data could transform business outcomes. 

Besides my interest in the data field, I have a passion for road trips. I love exploring new places and discovering scenic routes which are all refreshing for my life.
# What I hope to learn

- How to make impressive visualizations to interpret business insights effectively
- Systematically learn the color theory and visual perception and apply them to data visualizations
- Get hands-on practice with tools like Tableau or PowerBI to make better graphs
- Learning how to use visualization to tell a good business story.
- Will look for jobs as data scientist or data analyst after graduation.
