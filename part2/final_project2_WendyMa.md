## Target audience
The primary audience are college students (ages 18-22) who experience sleep difficulties 
and secondary audience are young adults (23-30) dealing with sleep issues.
I am one of them who have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. I want to explore the reasons behind insufficient sleep and provide some solutions to help them improve their sleep quality.


## Interview script
I will interview:
A current college student with sleep problems
A recent graduate who struggled with sleep during college
A student who always stays up late to study

| Which visualization was most/least clear to you and why? <br/>Is the color coding helpful in understanding the data?<br/>What elements of the charts were confusing or unclear? | The summarization of 70% people have insufficient sleep is impressive. It will take some time to understand the plot of recommend sleep for different age group.                              | The bar chart about reasons for poor sleep. It's straightforward and relatable. The plot of recommend sleep need to scroll to see the full version                                                    | The conclusion that income level doesn't affect the percentage of insufficient sleep is interesting.                                                                 |

I am struggle because of the top reason as well. I would like to see more recommendations to improve sleep not only three of them. | I like the map plot which shows that where I should go to if I could get more sleep. The trend is interesing in that plot.   The call to action could be more detailed and related to previous plots. | There is only one plot about the survey for the influence on daily activies. It would be better if there is more information about the negative influence on health. |
| Is the text size and font easy to read? <br/>Are the titles and labels clear and informative?                                                                                   | On the page of impact on daily activity, the conclusion font could be bigger.                                                                                                                 | You could try to add the conclusion as the title of map plot.                                                                                                                                         | The font of the sleep reasons could be bigger.                                                                                                                       |
